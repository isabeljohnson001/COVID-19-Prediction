### About the dataset

In this project, we will work with a dataset containing a posteroanterior (PA) view of chest X-ray images comprising Normal, Viral, and CVOID-19 affected patients. There are total 1823 CXR images.We propose COVIDLite, a deep neural network-based diagnostic method using CXR images, combining image preprocessing and DSCNN for accurate COVID-19 and viral pneumonia detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
